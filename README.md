This app makes calls to the api found at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/demolition-permits/e4xk-pud8 and displays relevant records.

It then geolocates entries and filters results according to user specified information.

Use it to visualize and parse through recent demolition permit entries in Chicago, IL.

The data.cityofchicago.org demolition record api does not provide dated entries so it is not feasible to allow users to search by date of filing.
